Project Description

This project modifies an existing Jetpack Compose app to display a list of degree programs from Maharishi International University (MIU). By collecting program names and descriptions from the MIU website, the app will present detailed information about various academic offerings. The objective is to improve the app's functionality, readability, and maintainability through best coding practices. The final app will feature an intuitive interface showcasing MIU's programs, each with a comprehensive description. A README file will document the project's purpose, setup instructions, and include a screenshot of the final output. This project highlights Jetpack Compose's flexibility and the importance of data integration in mobile app development.

Jetpack Compose Description

Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for building native Android apps, providing a simplified, declarative approach to UI development with Kotlin. It replaces traditional XML layouts with composable functions, enhancing flexibility and reducing code complexity. Part of the Android Jetpack suite, Compose integrates seamlessly with other Jetpack components and supports reactive programming for dynamic UIs. It promotes code reusability and readability, with powerful tools in Android Studio for rapid iteration. Jetpack Compose is the future of Android UI development, offering a more efficient and enjoyable experience.
